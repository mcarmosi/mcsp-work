<p>Currently, these problems are just sorted by the order in which they were emailed to me. As we accumulate more problems, I will organize them by topic instead.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MCSP for Weak Classes:</strong> We could study variants of MCSP such as: finding the sparsest polynomial threshold function, the sparsest linear combination of degree-2 polynomials, etc. In some cases (e.g. find the lowest degree threshold function) the problem is known to be in P. Scott Aaronson had a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0107010">paper</a> about this. (contributed by: Ryan Williams)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish that FO Reductions to MCSP are Unlikely:</strong> Prove a theorem of the form (MCSP is NP-complete under uniform AC^0 m-reductions) implies (something unlikely). <em>[I have trouble believing that such a reduction really exists. I’m less sure, when it comes to nonuniform reductions. – Eric]</em> (contributed by: Eric Allender)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconditional Circuit Lower Bounds for MCSP:</strong> Prove that MCSP is not in AC0[2]. We know the related problem MKTP (which measures the time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of a string) is indeed not in AC0[p], by two distinct proof techniques: a reduction from Determinant of <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/8063/pdf/LIPIcs-MFCS-2017-54.pdf">Allender, Hirahara 2017</a> and a pseudorandom generator argument of <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7540/pdf/LIPIcs-CCC-2017-7.pdf">Hirahara, Santhanam 2017</a>. Proving the bound for MCSP should be possible. (contributed by: Eric Allender).</p></li>
<li><strong>Show that various results about MKTP also hold for MCSP:</strong> For example, prove:
<ul>
<li>DET AC^0-many-one reduces to MCSP</li>
<li>Graph Isomorphism is in ZPP^MCSP</li>
</ul>
<p>(contributed by: Eric Allender)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NP-Hardness for restricted MCSP:</strong> Either prove that MCSP for depth-3 AC^0 circuits is NP-complete, or understand why this is unlikely. The state of the art is a proof that MCSP for DNF-of-parities is NP-complete by <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/frontdoor.php?source_opus=8883">(Hirahara, Oliveira, Santhanam 2018)</a>. (contributed by: Eric Allender)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SZK-hardness for restricted MCSP:</strong> Show that the minimum formula size problem is hard for SZK, or is at least hard for GI, under, say, P/poly reductions. (contributed by: Eric Allender)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formal Relationships between MCSP and MKTP:</strong> We know some settings in which (MCSP^A is hard for a class) implies (MKTP^A is hard for a class) from <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/8063/">(Allender, Hirahara 2017)</a>. Can stronger results in this direction be proved? (contributed by: Eric Allender)</p></li>
