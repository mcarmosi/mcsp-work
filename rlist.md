<!-- slot in igor somewhere -- mag mcsp/mktp -->

<!-- mrnial arithmetic natural proofs? (idea arithmetic mcsp -->

<!-- toni's paper on NP-hardness of pac-learning random halfpspaces -->

<!-- state of the art in upper bounds on real mcsp? NOT natural proofs -->

<!-- succinct mcsp? work by umans? approximtion versions in pi2? -->

<!-- On the Average-Case Complexity of MCSP and Its Variants? maybe
covered by hardness magnification -->

<!-- shuichi/eric: New Insights on the (Non-)Hardness of Circuit Minimization and Related Problems. -->
